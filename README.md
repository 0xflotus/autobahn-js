# **Autobahn**|JS

**Autobahn**|JS is a subproject of the [Autobahn project](http://autobahn.ws/) and provides an open-source implementation of the **[Web Application Messaging Protocol V2](http://wamp.ws/)** in JavaScript

It is licensed under the [MIT licensed](/LICENSE).

WAMP provides asynchronous **Remote Procedure Calls** and **Publish & Subscribe** for applications in *one* protocol running over [WebSocket](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) (and fallback transports for old browsers).

**Autobahn**|JS runs on both **Web browsers** and **[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)**.

WAMP enables application architectures with application code distributed freely across processes and devices according to functional aspects. Since WAMP implementations exist for multiple languages, WAMP applications can be polyglott. Application components can be implemented in a language and run on a device which best fit the particular use case.
